    <h3>Human history</h2>
    <p>
      Humans, also known as Men or Atani, were one of the races inhabiting Arda. They were the second of the Children of Ilúvatar, awakening in Hildórien at the rising of the Sun after the Elves and Dwarves had been made. They were called the “Afterborn” by the Elves.
      The essence of the song sung by Ilúvatar and the Ainur symbolized the history of the whole universe and the Children of Ilúvatar that were to dwell in it Men and Elves. Men were given the “Gift of Men”, which is mortality, and therefore aged and died when their time came. This meant that Men were not bound to Arda as Elves were. Even the Valar did not know what ultimate fate awaited the souls of Men, as this was known only to Eru. Ilúvatar declared that, after the worlds end, the Atani, and not Elves, would play a part in the “Second Music of the Ainur”.

    <h3>Famous settlement</h2>
    <p>
      One of the most notable human settlements in Arda is the city of Gondor. Gondor is a prominent kingdom of Men located in the south of Middle-earth, and it plays a significant role in J.R.R. Tolkien’s legendarium. The city is known for its grand architecture, including the towering fortress of Minas Tirith. Gondor is often at the forefront of the struggle against the forces of evil in Middle-earth, making it a key location in the epic tales of “The Lord of the Rings”.

    <h3>Notable heroes</h2>
    <p>
      One of the most notable human heroes in Arda is Beren, a hero of love, compassion, and unimaginable courage. He is known for his epic quest to retrieve a Silmaril from the Iron Crown of Morgoth, a task set to him as a bride price for Lúthien, the elf maiden he loved. Despite the insurmountable odds, Beren, with the help of Lúthien, successfully completed his quest, demonstrating his bravery and determination. His tale is one of the most celebrated stories in the history of Arda.
