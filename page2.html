  <h3>Elven history</h2>
    <p>
      Elves, also known as the Quendi or “the speakers”, were the first of the Children of Ilúvatar. They were directly created by the supreme deity Eru Ilúvatar and first awoke in Middle-earth beside the lake of Cuiviénen. The first things they saw were the stars, and henceforth they adored them. The first sound they heard was the flowing of water, and henceforth they loved water as well. Being the first race around, it was the elves who also officially “made speech,” and it was also the elves who first had to deal with the evil of Morgoth. The Elves are distinguished from the other two races, the Men and the Dwarves, especially by the fact of their near immortality.

    <h3>Famous settlement</h2>
    <p>
      One of the most notable Elven settlements in Tolkiens world is the city of Rivendell, also known as Imladris. Nestled in a hidden valley, Rivendell is described as a haven of beauty and tranquility, filled with waterfalls, trees, and beautiful Elven architecture. It is the home of Elrond, the Half-elven, and serves as a sanctuary and council place for the forces of good. Another significant Elven realm is Lothlórien, ruled by Galadriel and Celeborn. Known for its golden Mallorn trees, Lothlórien is said to be one of the most beautiful places in Middle-earth. In the west, the Grey Havens, or Mithlond, serves as the port from which the Elves depart Middle-earth to journey to the Undying Lands. These settlements, among others, play crucial roles in the events of Middle-earth.
