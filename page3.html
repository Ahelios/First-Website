  <h2>Orcs</h2>

  <h3>Orc history</h2>
    <p>
      Orcs, also known as Goblins, were a race of humanoid monsters. The origin of the Orcs is never definitely explained in Tolkien’s works. Throughout the years, he changed the explanation, but he was doubtful because of the theological implications of an evil race and the relations of fëa and hröa in his cosmology. The first conception in The Book of Lost Tales describes explicitly how Melko created Orcs or Goblins directly from earth: for all that race were bred by Melko of the subterranean heats and slime. Their hearts were of granite and their bodies deformed
